## Assumptions
- edition_count = the edition of a title
- genre will be omitted because I cannot find any genre in the open library response
- there will be 2 get api, 1 for librarian, 1 for user
- cover id is unique between book
- since there is no authorization, borrowing book will require user id input
- book information will include:
    - coverId
    - title
    - authors
    - editionNumber
    - subjects
